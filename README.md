# Cub3d
This program is a tribute to the [Wolfenstein 3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D) game.
Basically it is a raycasting algorithm rendering a game in a window, where a player can navigate through a map.    
The map is customizeable, following a set of rules detailed on the subject attached.
This program uses the minilibx graphic library to interact with the OS.
